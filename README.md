This module can let all apps use force dark mode in MIUI 13.

You have to reboot or reinstall this module to load new install app and reboot again to apply the new list in your system because of Magisk limit. 

(I won't keep a script to monitor what app you install by anytime, only on boot do)

If you want to load new installed app by reboot two times, you have at least wait for one minute for the second reboot.

Welcome branch to let this module more useful.
